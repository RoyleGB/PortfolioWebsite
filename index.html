            Currently completing my final year of study at Manchester Metropolitan University, excited to continue my 
            passion for programming in the near future with a graduate programme in 2025. Programming language skills in Java, 
            Javascript, Python, C, C++, GO, along with extensive frameworks and libraries including: Node.js, Express.js, SpringBoot 
            all shown within my academic projects and projects in my spare time, in addition to me showing great problem solving and 
            time management skills.
