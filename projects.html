                <h3>Year one - Programming</h3>
                <p>This project was a point and click game using the framework
                    Processing 4 which is a 2D/3D rendering engine using
                    Java programming language.
                    The aim of this project was to get to grips with the basics
                    of java and fundemental programming concepts.
                    Within the game i used abstarction, polymorpthism and inheritance
                    to create a game that was fun and engaging.
                    I managed to get 96 out of 100 for this project.

                <h3>Year Two - Full-Stack Web Development </h3>
                <p>This was a full stack web devlopement project where I had to
                    create a twitter clone using Javascript, Node.js and Express.js
                    for the backend and HTML, CSS and Javascript plus Vue.js for the frontend.
                    It had to have the ability to post tweets, follow users and like tweets.
                    Users had to be able to sign up and log in.
                    It had a full working database using SQLite and was intergrated with the backend.

                <h3>Year 3 - Programming Langauges & Paradigms</h3>
                <p>This project was a fast paced one were we were taught 11 
                    differetq programming languages in 11 weeks. We were also 
                    taught the differnt paradigms of programming languages.
                    We had to create three projects to show the
                    differnt paradigms in three different language.
                    I chose to use C, Python and GO.
                    The project was a terminal based game, I chose
                    to do a battleships game as it was simple and easy to.
